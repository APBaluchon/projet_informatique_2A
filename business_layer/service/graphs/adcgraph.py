class AdcGraph(Graph):
    """
    A class representing the ADC graph, inheriting from Graph.

    This class specializes in creating a graph for the ADC role in a game,
    focusing on specific indicators relevant to this role.

    Attributes
    ----------
    indicators : dict
        A dictionary mapping indicator symbols to their respective formulas
        and explanations. Each indicator represents a specific metric relevant
        to the ADC role, such as damage per minute or minions killed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pseudo : str
        The pseudo of the player for whom the graph is being generated.
